# SST Dev Guide/Tutorial Excercise repository

This is a repository dedicated for learning Serverless Stack (SST) tool with AWS.
It strictly follows the official guide from [https://guide.sst.dev/](https://guide.sst.dev/)

## Usage
***NOTE: The following section has been copied from the source template repository***

This template uses [npm Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces). It has 3 packages to start with and you can add more it.

1. `core/`

   This is for any shared code. It's defined as modules. For example, there's the `Example` module.

   ```ts
   export module Example {
     export function hello() {
       return "Hello, world!";
     }
   }
   ```

   That you can use across other packages using.

   ```ts
   import { Example } from "@aws-monorepo/core/example";

   Example.hello();
   ```

   We also have [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) configured for testing this package with the `sst shell` CLI.

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. `functions/`

   This is for your Lambda functions and it uses the `core` package as a local dependency.

3. `scripts/`

    This is for any scripts that you can run on your SST app using the `sst shell` CLI and [`tsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx). For example, you can run the example script using:

   ```bash
   npm run shell src/example.ts
   ```

### Infrastructure

The `infra/` directory allows you to logically split the infrastructure of your app into separate files. This can be helpful as your app grows.

In the template, we have an `api.ts`, and `storage.ts`. These export the created resources. And are imported in the `sst.config.ts`.
